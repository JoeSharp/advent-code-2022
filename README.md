# advent-code-2022

This repo contains my code solution for the Advent of Code challenges

[Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

## To run

The index.ts file selects the day to run. So you will need to modify that to run the required day challenge.

Once modified, the following command will run that days challenge and print out the answers for part 1 and 2.

Run

```
npm start
```

## To run tests

There is extensive unit testing in this repository.

When undertaking a new days challenge, I have programmed in the test using the example 'input' and 'answers' given.

Once my code successfully passes those tests, I can be reasonably confident it will scale up and work on the
larger input.

There are also extensive tests for all the consituent parts of solutions. I used TDD throughout.

To run tests

```
npm run test
```
